# SwipeApp

This is a simple application that allows the user to swipe between pages. The app is for iOS and it was written using swift with storyboard but I've decided to create the application programmatically.

I've color coded the pages for the user to clearly observe the turning of the pages:

This is the first page the user see upon launching the application:

Some page effect is added when the user turns to the next page:

And we see the next page:

The page effect is coded to all pages:
